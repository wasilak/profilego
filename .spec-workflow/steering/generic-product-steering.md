# Generic Go Library Product Steering

## Overview
This document provides generic product steering principles that can be adapted for any Go library development project.

## Core Product Principles
1. **Modularity**: Design libraries as modular, reusable components
2. **Performance**: Optimize for Go's performance characteristics
3. **Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with Go ecosystem standards
4. **Reliability**: Implement robust error handling and validation
5. **Developer Experience**: Provide clear APIs and comprehensive documentation

## Target Use Cases
- Library development for various domains
- Reusable components and utilities
- Integration with existing Go projects
- Performance-critical applications

## Product Boundaries
- Focus on library functionality and API design
- Maintain separation between core logic and integration layers
- Prioritize performance and reliability over feature richness
- Keep complexity manageable through clear architectural patterns

## Success Metrics
- Code quality and maintainability
- API usability and adoption
- Performance benchmarks
- Test coverage and reliability
- Community feedback and contributions

## Adaptation Guidelines
This document should be adapted for specific projects by:
1. Replacing generic descriptions with project-specific details
2. Adding domain-specific requirements
3. Including project-specific success metrics
4. Adjusting boundaries based on actual project scope
